## General Principals

Cyqur Javascript code is held in the public domain such as this website or a repository.

https://github.com/Binarii-Labs-Products/cyqur-0.0.0.1-production/

As with most code, there are always ways to improve its speed, redundancy and security and upgrades with aim to follow community best practice. 

There are no third party libraries such as jquery or calls to CDNs and if there is any code with MIT or other licence notifications they are prominently disclosed. However, if there is integration with cloud providers or token providers, we aim to disclose how this interaction works. We also aim to create threat models to help users understand their own risk appetites.

The code is minified and can be unminified easily. There is no obscurification.
The encrypted secret saved to the Vault is in JSON format. The secret is encrypted as a name / value. The JSON is also encrypted. 

#### Storage

Certain data is stored in the Browser. This can be in hidden fields on the webpage; session Storage; local Storage; local IndexedDB; Cookies (although Cyqur does not use Cookies). 

No data is sent to a server or requested from a server. The only exception is where a token has been given to the user for the purposes of being able to backup fragments to other services along with tokens issued for usage of the app. Third party cloud service providers may also be used to store and for retrieval of fragmented secrets.

The Vault uses the IndexedDB storage. Local Storage is used for faster interaction and as a cache.

#### Wipe Everything

In Settings, the Wipe Everything deletes all the browser data. However, the indexedDB may be open and may not delete properly so it is advised the app and Browser are closed down and then reopened.

Example LR00 is Localstore containing Raw data (encrypted) where 00 = full packet of all fragments; 01 = fragment 1; CR00 - C represents the fragment is stored on a cloud and a URL is available. On decryption, a JSON object will have the D and MD. The integrity of the packet can be established by Encrypting the Data and TS and proving PUK. Local database uses the PUK as an index. This is currently raw JSON text.


## White Paper


#### Summary
Encrypt and decrypt data strings. Fragment and cloud scatter. Record locations. Index on a blockchain. Transmit to COLR. Backup. Import. Delete audit trail.

#### Glossary

- D = Raw data / plain text
- ED = Encrypted Data / cipher text
- MP = Main Password
- AP = Alternative Password
- MD = Meta Data which includes
- TS = date and time stamp when encryption was made
- TG = Tags or keywords describing what is in the secret
- PUK = Public Key
- BPUK = Blockchain Public Key
- H = Internal hash
- E = Encoding of the data such as base64 with URI encoding for non Latin1 character sets
- EP = Encryption Algorithm used (e.g AES-GCM)
- NORF = Number of real Fragments
- NOF = Number of real and spoofed Fragments (for later use)

#### Calculations

- NORF = 10
- FD = D + MD in JSON format. 
- ED = Encrypt(FD, MP/AP, EP). 
- PUK = sha256(ED + TS) implies low collision. 

- L = Localstore. L records ED and fn = ED/NORF fragments. 
- I = Local database used for searching purposes
- LR00 = Local Raw Full Packet
- LRnn = Local Raw Packet
- LR0X = Local Raw Packet where X=A or B or C
- CE00 = Cloud Encrypted Full Packet using Double Password
- BC?? = Blockchain related meta
- BCBC = Blockchain / Protocol
- BCTX = Transaction Hash
